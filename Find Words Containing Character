You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.



/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {character} x
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findWordsContaining = function(words, x) {
    let res = []
    for(let i in words ){
        if(words[i].includes(x)){
            res.push(i)
        }
    }return res
};



const findWordsContaining=(words, x)=>{
    let res = []
    words.forEach((word,i)=>{
        if(word.includes(x)){
            res.push(i)
        }
    })
    return res
}
